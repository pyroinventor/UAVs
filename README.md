# UAVs
For about as long as I can remember, I've been fascinated with two things; remote control technology and flying vehicles.
This repo serves as a log of all the RC aerial vehicles I've built that I have a record of.

## RC Trainer - Samm Sheperd
I'm pretty sure this is my first RC plane. I followed the late Samm Sheperd's tutorial for an RC trainer build that employs the use of a DIY hotwire foam cutter to acheive an efficient airfoil.

I remember staring in disbelief as the plane actually floated through the air for awhile before crashing into a tree.

## Wizard X220
I had been gifted a couple toy drones over the years, but my first real racing drone was the Wizard X220. I ordered it off of banggood and was so excited to fly it I could hardly contain myself.

Motor Upgrade

## Albatross
After flying my drone into the ground every other flight got too expensive, I used one of its motors for a smaller, foam board based plane nicknamed Albatross:

## Biplane
After doing a few more builds similar to albatross, I wanted to make something a little more like an actual airplane. I came up with this paper mached foam biplane design that only survived one flight as I wasn't very good at flying 4 channel aircraft yet.

## Navigator
This plane was my first foray into stablilized fixed wings. I used an f4 flight controller running INav to enable features like heading hold, auto take off, horizon mode, and other cool features. The hardest part was soldering all the servo and ESC connectors, 15 tiny pads.

## Sparrow
I built this around the same time as Navigator. I wanted a simple, smaller, "dumb" plane to compare it to.

## Flying Arrow
I built this flying wing with the intention of adding FPV, but I crashed it beyond repair before getting the chance. This design really requires a flight control board as it's inherently unstable and difficult to manually mix the elevon controls without the help of a computer.

## Flywoo LR 4
I put this mini drone together with the intention of adding a camera, namely the Hawkeye Firefly X Lite, and using the open source stabilization software GyroFlow to get some nice footage out of it. By the time I had figured out Gyroflow, my cheap betaFPV radio crapped out and I had to wait until I could afford a new transmitter.

Relatively high efficiency for its small size, and GPS support!

## Motor Glider
I'm not sure this belongs on the list, but I designed a motor glider in my Solidworks class:

![motor_glider_v1](https://github.com/pyroinventor/UAVs/assets/77114423/72f50b9d-dbac-4df6-8f87-1a72d13e5b08)

I envisioned building it to run off of a single 18650 cell, have thin film PV panels on the wings, and use a foldable prop for maximum gliding efficiency.
